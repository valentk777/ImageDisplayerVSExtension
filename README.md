# ImageDisplayerVSExtension

## Concept

This is a VisualStudio extension to display your selected image or gif inside VisualStudio.
The initial purpose of this extension was to try how to create VS extension in general, but I found this extension kind of fun to use too. It makes VS environment a bit cozier.


## Demo

## How to use
You can add this extension the same way as all regular VS extensions.

After installation, select View -> Other Windows -> DisplayImage.

Then press on the white section (maybe later I will improve that part) and select the image you want to import.

And that is it!

This extension supports multiple image formats like png, jpg, and animation format - gif.
