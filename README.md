# ImageDisplayerVSExtension

![Published](https://www.vsixgallery.com/extension/8864c6b6-57eb-408e-9507-33e1debf80be)


## Concept

This is a VisualStudio extension to display your selected image or gif inside VisualStudio.
The initial purpose of this extension was to try how to create VS extension in general, but I found this extension kind of fun to use too. It makes VS environment a bit cozier.


## Demo

Check it out - a demo to see the extension functionality

## How to use
You can add this extension the same way as all regular VS extensions.

After installation, select View -> Other Windows -> Display Image.

Then press on the white section (maybe later I will improve that part) and select the image you want to import.

And that is it!


## Support
This extension supports multiple image formats (.jpg, .jpeg, .png), and animation format - .gif.


## CI/CD
I use appveyor for CI/CD builds and releases
