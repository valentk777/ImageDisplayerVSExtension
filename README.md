# ImageDisplayerVSExtension

## Concept

This is VisualStudio extension to display your selected image or gif inside VisualStudio.
The key purpose of this extension was to try how to create VS extension in general, but I found this extension kind of fun to use too. It makes VS environment a bit cozier.

## How to use
You can add this extension the same way as all regular VS extensions.

After installation, select View -> Other Windows -> DisplayImage.
